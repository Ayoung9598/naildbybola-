Booking is still not sending anything to the backend, no api call their as I am seeing a "local host 3000 says Thank you for your message! We will contact you soon to confirm your appointment.". Shouldn't there be api calls there and where is the backend?

The share your experience button is not responsive so as to pop up the form, and I am sure there is no api call for that form submission too

Also the view all button is not opening a dedicated page to view that particular service

The newsletter should be at the buttom, not under our services, and it's also not responsive anyway


Are all these happening because I am using html and js, and not react??
